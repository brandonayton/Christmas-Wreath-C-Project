# Christmas Wreath Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SPI communication to interface a Nucleo microcontroller (STM32L4 series) with a PCD8544 GLCD screen. The display shows a festive Christmas message and the current LED mode of a wreath. Additionally, UART communication between the microcontroller and a laptop allows the user to send commands that control the LED modes. The system employs interrupts to handle incoming UART messages in real-time, ensuring responsive and seamless operation. The combination of SPI, UART, and interrupts creates an engaging and interactive holiday decoration.
